# @kenhoff does dotfiles

Hi there! These are my dotfiles.

To run, just `sh engage.sh`. However, I'd recommend building your own bootstrapping script from scratch!

For more info on dotfiles, check out [Zach Holman's post](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) and [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/).
